<h1>Synthesis-Of-Electroglottography-Signal</h1>

<p> In this deep learning project, we synthesis the electroglottography signal from speech signal using Deep Feature Loss. The Neural Network(CNN) is been used for the learning of the signal.</p>

<h3>The code of this project is not uploaded because paper on this is on going process.</h3>
